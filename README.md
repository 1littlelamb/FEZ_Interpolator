## FEZ Interpolator

Used for quickly interpolating the properties of air at different temperatures.  

Simply enter the variable from which we will interpolate followed by it's value.  
  
For example:  
```h 265.34```  
```T 432.86```

## Installation

Simply download the `.py` and `.txt` files into the same directory  
Open up the command prompt and navigate to the same directory  
Run the code by typing `python FEZ_Interpolator.py`  
  
If you don't have python doqnloaded with the correct env var setup  
you should look up how to do that and then try again.
